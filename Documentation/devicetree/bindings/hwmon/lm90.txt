		"dallas,max6696"
		"onnn,nct1008"
		"winbond,w83l771"
		"nxp,sa56004"

- reg: I2C bus address of the device

- vcc-supply: vcc regulator for the supply voltage.

- #thermal-sensor-cells: Should be 1. See ../../thermal/thermal.txt for a
                         description of this property. Use the following
                         values to refer to a specific sensor:
                         0: chip internal sensor
                         1: external sensor
                         2: second external sensor, if present

Optional properties:
- interrupts: Contains a single interrupt specifier which describes the
              LM90 "-ALERT" pin output.
              See interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for the format.

- update-interval: Interval at which temperatures are sampled,
  Type: unsigned   in milliseconds.
  Size: one cell

- local-low:      Valid temperature range for the chip internal sensor,
  local-high:     outside which the alert will be set. Values are in
  local-critical: millicelcius.
  Type: signed
  Size: one cell

- remote-low:      Valid temperature range for the external sensor,
  remote-high:     outside which the alert will be set. Values are in
  remote-critical: millicelciius.
  Type: signed
  Size: one cell

- remote-offset:   Where available, an external sensor temperature offset.
  Type: signed
  Size: one cell

- local-emergency:  On max6659, max6695 and max6696, a configurable
  remote-emergency: 3rd upper bound on temperature.
  Type: signed
  Size: one cell

- remote2-low:      On max6695 and max6696, a second external sensor.
  remote2-high:
  remote2-critical:
  remote2-emergency:
  Type: signed
  Size: one cell
